          impersonation, unlawful conduct, or constitutes harassment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any use, reliance on, or collection of any User Content or materials
          displayed via the Services or obtained by you through the Services is
          at your own risk. We do not endorse, support, represent or guarantee
          the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any User

        <p>
          User Content may embody, comprise or otherwise be associated with
          certain characters, artwork, or other work of authorship
          (&quot;Artwork&quot;) made available by Profiles (who may represent
          artists, musicians and other creators) for collecting in the form of
          non-fungible tokens (a &quot;Token&quot; or &quot;Tokens&quot;).
        </p>
        <p>
          All transactions related to the Service, including making a Token
          available for collecting are effected and recorded solely through the
          interactions of the Profile with the blockchain based networks, which
          are not under the control of or affiliated with the Service. The
          Service does not hold, and cannot purchase, sell, or trade any tokens,
          nor can the Service set, change or enforce any conditions for
          collecting set by the Profile.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon you collecting a Token, although the Token is owned by you, the
          Artwork embodied thereby is licensed and not transferred or sold to
          you. Ownership means that the ownership of the Token is recoded on
          blockchain-based networks. Subject to your lawful acquisition, and
          continued ownership of a Token, the user controlling the Profile
          grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, revocable, royalty-free
          license, with no right to sublicense, on as-is basis, to display the
          Artwork embodied by such Token(s), unless a more expansive license is
          granted to you in accordance with the Token metadata. For the
          avoidance of doubt, to be granted the license above, you must
          independently verify the right of the user controlling the Profile to
          make the Token available for collecting (including, without
          limitation, copyright).
        </p>
        <p>
          All Tokens are provided by the Profiles on an as-is basis without any
          warranty or representation of any kind, express or implied. The Tokens
          may contain errors and it is the responsibility of the acquiring user
          to independently verify the accuracy, completeness and suitability for
          the purpose of the Token before collecting.
        </p>
        <p>
          We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to remove any content
          that we deem inappropriate, harmful, or otherwise unsuitable for the
