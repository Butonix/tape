# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

```
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
npx hardhat verify 0x21970AD5c43e90184A62674fAC54f4Bed030Fb74 --network polygonMumbai 
```
