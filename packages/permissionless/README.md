# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

```
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
npx hardhat verify 0x313d9f4bB72160D3Aef52656849e6cB6f1D21E7B --network polygonMumbai 
```
